"Greetings, fellow countrymen, I embark on a work trip,
This journey is bound to be lengthy, I know. 
I ask my loved ones to hold back their sorrow, 
And cherish our nation with unwavering hearts. 


Everyone will eventually depart, but I go first, 
The dreams of the future continue to be built. 
If you remember me with affection,
Know that honor is the most sacred and noble virtue."</pre
